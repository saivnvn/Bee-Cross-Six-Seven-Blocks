## 🎮 About the Game
**Bee Cross – 67 Number Puzzle** is a fresh and clever logic-puzzle game where you guide a little bee across a **10×10 number maze** to reach Home safely.

Each tile contains a **positive or negative number**, and your mission is simple yet challenging:  
**Find a valid path so that the total sum of all numbers you step on equals *zero*** by the time you reach Home.

> Sounds simple… until spider nests appear, numbers grow wilder, and every decision matters.

As levels increase, the number range expands from **–1 → 1** all the way to **–5 → 5**, forcing you to plan, calculate, and pick every step with care.  
And that’s only the beginning—many more surprises await you.

### ✨ Key Features
